Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm David!

I'm a Software Engineer passionate about building reactive, user-focused applications. 
My goal is to craft seamless, accessible, and innovative user experiences, with a focus on full-stack development.

With hands-on experience in TypeScript, Angular, NgRx, and Material Design Components, I've contributed to modern, compliant financial technology solutions at BEC Financial Technologies. 
Additionally, my background as a Business Analyst has equipped me with a strong foundation in gathering requirements and collaborating with stakeholders to deliver value-driven features.
