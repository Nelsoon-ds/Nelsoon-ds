Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m David!
Thanks for visiting my GitHub! Iâ€™m a software developer who genuinely enjoys building things that people find useful and intuitive. Whether itâ€™s crafting a smooth user interface, designing a solid backend, or making an app accessible for everyone, I take pride in creating solutions that feel natural and work well.

These days, Iâ€™m working with TypeScript, Angular, and NgRx, often pairing them with Material Design to build clean, responsive applications. At BEC Financial Technologies, Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to work on fintech projects that tackle real-world problems, balancing innovation with compliance in some pretty interesting ways.

Before jumping into development, I spent time as a Business Analyst. That experience gave me a real appreciation for understanding what people need and figuring out how to deliver it in the best way possible.

Feel free to check out my projects or reach outâ€”Iâ€™m always happy to connect, share ideas, and learn from others in the tech world.
